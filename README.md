## Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

This is a simple Java-based console game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too low or too high, and tracks the number of attempts made by the player.

### How to Play
1. Run the program, and it will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The program will prompt you to enter your guess.
3. If your guess is lower than the number, it will display "Too low! Try again."
4. If your guess is higher than the number, it will display "Too high! Try again."
5. When you guess the correct number, the program congratulates you and displays the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.

### Features
- **Random Number Generation:** The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 for each new game.
- **User Input Validation:** The program continuously prompts the user until the correct number is guessed.
- **Feedback:** After each guess, the program provides feedback, making it easier to zero in on the correct number.
- **Attempt Tracking:** The total number of attempts is displayed when the player guesses the correct number.

### How to Run
Compile and run the `GuessingGame.java` file using a Java IDE or the command line:

```bash
javac GuessingGame.java
java GuessingGame
```

Enjoy the game and try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible!
